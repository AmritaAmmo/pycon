{% endfor %}
## Mentees
{% for mentee in mentees %}  - {{ mentee }}

## How to meet:

Someone in the group must coordinate a video call and share the link ahead of the meeting. We recommend Google Hangouts or similar.

Additionally, it is recommended that someone create a calendar invitation and send it to all other participants.

## Before you meet:

### Definitely

  - Review the PyCon Code of Conduct: https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/
  - Review the Attendee Procedure for Handling Code of Conduct violations: https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/

By participating in the mentorship session you agree to comply with the PyCon Code of Conduct while meeting with your group.

### Recommended

  - Prepare a brief introduction and what kind of support you are looking for as part of the session.
  - Share text of your proposal(s) with the group via email prior to your scheduled time, using a collaborative editor like Google Docs will help share and integrate feedback from mentors.
  - Review any responses to the email thread from other participants

## What to do during the meeting:

Adhere to PyCon's Code of Conduct while participating.

Please use this hour to the fullest! Here is a "Starter Agenda":

- 0:00 - 5:00: Deal with the bugs and frustrations of video calls. Fix mics, cameras, and screen sharing :-p. Wait for participants to join a bit late.
- 5:00 - 10:00: Introductions. Brief summary of the introduction email you provided ahead of the meeting via email, remind folks what you're looking to get out of the meeting.
- 10:00 - 15:00: Discuss as a group and consider if there are strong connections between mentor experience and mentee needs.
- 15:00 - 60:00: Consider breaking out into two more focused groups for the remainder of the hour.

We are leaning on the two volunteer mentors to facilitate and guide the discussion towards productive outcomes.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions please share them with pycon-mentorship@python.org
