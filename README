PyCon 2013 website being built on symposion by Eldarion.

Rather than use this as the basis for your conference site directly, you should instead look at
https://github.com/pinax/symposion which was designed for reuse. PyCon 2013 is built on top of
Pinax Symposion but may have customizations that will just make things more difficult for you.
